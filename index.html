    <h3> Artist Statement</h3>
    <ul> I feel like my inspiration comes from everything I engage with, especially the music I listen to and books I read like the manga My Hero Academia by Kohei Horikoshi. The style of his art and the stories that are told about the characters make me want to make my own stories and characters. As well as make art of the characters from MHA. Sabrina Carpenter and Paramore most of the time feel like my biggest inspirations, who give me the most motivation to create. Sabrina has been putting out music for over a decade and is just now getting the appreciation from the public that she deserves. She’s never felt like she had to adhere to musical trends or exclusively make music to become popular. She creates music that she loves and I really love her creativity. She puts her personality and sense of humor into her art and that’s something that I would love to do too. Paramore has gone through a lot of line up changes, but what has always stayed consistent is Hayley Williams. She’s not afraid to speak her mind and be confident in her beliefs, which I respect a ton.When it comes to my main outlet for art, I really enjoy doing poster design and creating art revolving around the songs and albums I love. As well as drawing and editing characters from shows, games, and books that I love. When it comes to having some kind of purpose for my work, it’s to make people happy or just to make me happy honestly. I do art for no one else other than myself really, so if the piece makes me happy and I’m proud of what I’ve done then I’ve done my job right. My favorite medium will always be graphic design work, especially using photoshop. As well as occasionally Illustrator, Indesign, and XD. Using those I’ve gotten more experience recently doing web design and advertising design. I even designed a whole website for a fictional brand in a class I took recently. I don’t really think that my work could ever really affect societal issues, as that’s not really the subject or objective of my art, but maybe someday I’d do something that helps with something. What mainly motivates me to create is my inspirations, the music that I love always motivates me in some shape or form to make my art. Motivation also just comes naturally from a drive to create something that I have. I think that the way that my style has changed over time is mainly just my skills improving overtime. The reason why I think that people should collect my art is that I put a lot of hard work and effort into them, hoping that at least one person will get enjoyment out of each piece. The pieces I make while they may not look full of emotion at the first glance, but in truth each one represents a part of me in a different format.

<h3>Artist Bio</h3>
<ul>Born on October 28th, 2002 in Fairfax, VA, Meghan Wood has been creating art for what feels like her whole life. She always had a passion for music and drawing, but her love for graphic design didn’t start until she discovered people making edits of Doctor Who characters on Instagram in 2015. That jump started her into teaching herself how to use photoshop, so she could make edits like that herself. She was completely self-taught in her graphic design skills until late 2017 when she took her first art class at Centreville High School. Meghan’s work tends to be focused on poster design and other types of designs revolving around the music artists that she loves. She has also had experience in website design and advertisement designs. Much of what she specializes in is fantasy and sci-fi-esque designs inspired by many of her favorite movies, shows, and books. Some of her main achievements include that she has edited a lot of her grandfather Rodger Wood’s sports photography, which has been published in sports magazines as well as baseball cards.  Now she’s currently in her 4th year at George Mason University majoring in Art and Visual Technology with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a minor in web design.
